# Download Roblox Audios

This is a simple ChatGPT python script to download private roblox audios, why I used ChatGPT? I was bored and didnt want to actually use this so I'm open sourcing this and just made this for fun.

You can download any private audio or public to your PC as a .ogg file and if you want you can reupload it and add it to your game!

This project has no license because of how this was a boredem project.
